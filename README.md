<h2>About</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Listen Network repository! This repository contains the codebase for the Listen Network website and app, providing users with a direct channel to express their ideas, participate in events, and contribute to their community's growth.</p>

<h2>Hackathon Collaboration with MadLab</h2>
<p>The Listen Network project was born out of a collaborative effort with MadLab, a community space in Manchester dedicated to digital creativity, collaboration, and innovation. During an exhilarating hackathon hosted by MadLab, passionate developers, designers, and community members came together to conceptualize and create the foundation for Listen Network.</p>

<h3>Key Highlights from the Hackathon</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Engagement and Innovation:</strong> The hackathon was a dynamic event where participants brainstormed, coded, designed, and discussed ideas to empower the community. It was an immersive experience that blended technical skills with community-focused vision.</li>
  <li><strong>Ideation and Collaboration:</strong> The event provided a platform for attendees to share their insights and perspectives about Stockport's needs. This collaborative process sparked creative solutions and ideas that formed the basis of Listen Network's mission.</li>
  <li><strong>Community-Centered Solutions:</strong> MadLab's hackathon fostered an environment where the local community's needs and aspirations took center stage. Participants leveraged technology to devise solutions that addressed real-world challenges faced by Stockport residents.</li>
</ul>
